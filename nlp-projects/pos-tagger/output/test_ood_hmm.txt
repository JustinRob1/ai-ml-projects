When WRB
Tyler PRP

very RB
young NN

his PRP$
grandmother NNS
was VBD
his PRP$
favorite JJ

Santa ``

His PRP$

always RB

often RB
a DT

but CC
his PRP$

a DT

A DT

when WRB
Tyler EX

she PRP

When WRB

Tyler ''

But CC
like IN
most JJS

, ,
when WRB
he PRP
grew VBD
older RBR
he PRP
could MD
only RB
recall PDT
the DT
intensity NN
of IN
that WDT
love VBP
in IN
childhood VBG
in IN
an DT
abstract JJ
way NN

He PRP
made VBD
the DT
common JJ
error NNS
of IN
identifying ``
maturity UH
with IN

and CC
assumed VBN
that IN
the DT

for IN
her PRP
as IN
a DT
young NN
child WDT
must MD
have VB
been VBN
lacking RP

strength NNP

For IN
many JJ
years NNS
after IN
her PRP$
death NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
Tyler WP
was VBD
tortured VBN
by IN
the DT
memory NN
of IN
a DT
certain JJ
visit NN
from IN
her PRP

He PRP
was VBD
five CD
or CC
so RB
, ,
and CC
they PRP
were VBD
playing PDT
some DT

game NN
at IN
the DT
kitchen NN

As IN
he PRP
swung VBP
his PRP$
legs NNS
in IN
his PRP$
excitement NNS

he PRP
kicked VBP
her PRP$
repeatedly NNS
in IN
the DT
shins NN

She VB
asked VBN
him PRP
to TO
stop VB
, ,
and CC
he PRP
refused VBP
, ,
giggling UH

When WRB
she PRP
finally RB
frowned VBN
at IN
him PRP
and CC
threatened WRB
to TO
stop VB
playing VBG
if IN
he PRP
did VBD
n’t RB
stop VB
he PRP
told VBP
her PRP
to TO
go VB
to IN
Hell NNP

In IN
Tyler NNP
’s POS
mind NN
he PRP
could MD
see VB
her PRP
face VBP
grow VB
taut UH
, ,
lose VB
color NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
only JJ
time NN
he PRP
could MD
remember VB
, ,
she PRP
began VBD
to TO
cry VB
. .

He PRP
also RB
remembered PDT
his PRP$
own JJ
utter JJ
confusion NNS

His PRP$
parents NNS
did VBD
not RB
have VBP
much RB
use VB
for IN
religion NN
and CC
so RB
for IN
him PRP
Hell .
was VBD
a DT
word NN
without IN
much JJ
mystery NNS
or CC
power NN
. .

At IN
that DT
time NN
he PRP
knew MD
only RB
vaguely RB
that IN
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
place NN
you PRP
did VBD
not RB
want VBP
to TO
go VB
, ,
like IN
the DT
dark JJ
basement NNS
or CC
the DT
even RB
darker JJR
attic NN
. .

He PRP
remembered VBP
feeling VBG
resentful RP
that IN
she PRP
was VBD
crying RP
and CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
even RB
understand VB
why RP
. .

Tyler LS
felt VB
the DT
guilt NN
of IN
this DT
memory RBS
even RB
in IN
his PRP$
teenage JJ
years NNS
. .

For IN
him PRP
it PRP
summed VBP
up RP
all PDT
his PRP$
insecurities NNS
and CC
fears VBN
about IN
his PRP$
own JJ
cruelty NNS
, ,
ignorance UH
, ,
and CC
the DT
possibility NN
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
, ,
in IN
reality NNP
, ,
not RB
a DT
good JJ
person NN
. .

The DT
fact NN
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
caused PRP$
someone NN
who WP
loved VBP
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
with IN
so RB
little JJ
effort NN
and CC
understanding EX
troubled VBP
him PRP
deeply VBP
. .

One CD
day NN
Tyler .
looked ''
through IN
an DT
old JJ
family NN
photo ``
album UH
, ,
and CC
in IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
picture NN
of IN
the DT
kitchen NN
in IN
the DT
house NN
they VBD
used VBN
to TO
live VB
in RP

He PRP
was VBD
surprised VBN
to TO
discover VB
that IN
the DT
small JJ
kitchen NN
contained IN
a DT
central JJ
island NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
no DT
space NN
for IN
the DT
table NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NNS
at IN
all DT

With IN
the DT
discovery NN
of IN
that DT
single JJ
error NNS
in IN
his PRP$
memory NNS
came VBD
a DT
cascade NN
of IN
other JJ
revelations NNS
. .

Now WRB
he PRP
remembered VBP
that IN
they PRP
always RB
ate VBN
in IN
the DT
dining NN
room NN
, ,
and CC
when WRB
they PRP
did VBD
play RB
board VBP
games RB
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
always RB
on IN
the DT
coffee NN
table VBD
in IN
the DT
living VBG
room NN
. .

The DT
memory NNPS
that WDT
had VBD
caused RBR
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
over IN
the DT
years NNS
could MD
not RB
possibly RB
have VB
occurred RP
. .

Somehow UH
, ,
he PRP
must MD
have VB
manufactured PDT
the DT
whole JJ
scene NN
in IN
his PRP$
imagination NNS
. .

It PRP
was VBD
not RB
very RB
hard JJ
to TO
explain VB
what WP
really VBD
happened VBN
, ,
he PRP
thought VBD
. .

The DT
death NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NNS
had VBD
probably RB
caused VBN
in IN
him PRP
feelings VBP
of IN
abandonment NNP
and CC
guilt NNS
. .

In IN
his PRP$
confusion ``
he PRP
had VBD
taken VBN
elements NNS
from IN
storybooks NNP
and CC
imagined VB
out RP
of IN
nothing NN
this DT
memory JJS
to TO
punish ``
himself UH
. .

This DT
was VBD
the DT
sort NN
of IN
fantasy NN
that WDT
could MD
have VB
occurred RP
to IN
any DT
young NN
child .
who WP
lost VBD
an DT
important JJ
relative NNS
. .

With IN
that DT
realization NNPS
, ,
the DT
image NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother ``
crying UH
faded ''
in IN
his PRP$
memory NNS
and CC
became VBD
less RBR
and CC
less RBR
believable JJ
. .

Tyler EX
thought VBD
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
lucky JJ
to TO
have VB
discovered VBN
the DT
single JJ
error NNS
in IN
his PRP$
false JJ
memory NNS
, ,
which WDT
enabled VBP
him PRP
to IN
reason NN
his PRP$
way NN
into IN
distinguishing VBG
between IN
reality NNP
and CC
fantasy NN
. .

He PRP
felt VBP
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
coming-of-age ``
moment UH
. .

Nonetheless UH
, ,
he PRP
admitted VBP
to TO
himself VB
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
a DT
little JJ
sad NNS
also RB
at IN
the DT
discovery NN

For IN
however RB
imaginary VBN
that IN
memory WP
was VBD
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
also RB
a DT
part NN
of IN
his PRP$
love NNS
for IN
his PRP$
grandmother NNS
. .

When WRB
that DT
memory NNPS
lost VBD
its PRP$
compelling ``
aura UH
of IN
truth NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
like IN
another DT
part NN
of IN
her PRP
died VBP
with IN
it PRP

He PRP
had VBD
no DT

for IN
the DT
emptiness NNPS
that WDT
remained VBP

I PRP

I PRP

She VB

The DT

She EX

“ ``

I JJ

The DT

I PRP

Even RB

how WRB

I PRP
just RB

I PRP

even RB

That DT

Even RB

I PRP

But CC
that DT

I PRP

still RB
working VBG
up RP

Every DT

Maybe WRB
I PRP

maybe RB

Then RB
again RB

Pag EX

parents WP

look VB
what WP

: :
a DT

a DT

In IN
the DT

propaganda EX
worked VBZ
where WRB

Back VB
then RB
I PRP
did VBD

so RB
much RB
think VB

deduce RBR

much RB

what WP
I PRP

was VBD
a DT

So RB
I PRP

up RP
a DT
rock NN
the DT

hit VB
two CD

even RB

A DT

the DT

that WDT
audibly VBZ

I PRP

why WRB
I PRP

why WRB
it PRP

nothing NN

I PRP

one PRP

The DT
rest NN

the DT

One CD

the DT

I PRP

dead RB

over IN
his PRP$

disappeared VBP
around IN
the DT

Three CD
decades NNS
it PRP

the DT
irony NN
in IN
that DT

Two CD

the DT

I PRP
kicked VBP
one CD

until IN
it PRP
stopped VBP

turned VBD

Something LS

my PRP$

I PRP

without IN

" ``
Oh UH

I JJ

One CD

The DT

" ``

Blood LS
coursed VB

His PRP$

The DT

I PRP
